    "# KCMC Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of points of interest (POIs) that are static locations in space that continuously produce information. To gather that information, the POIs must be monitored by SENSORS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors have a limited \"sensing range\", so often a sensor cannot monitor a POI because it is too far away, \"out of range\". When a POI is monitored by a sensor, it must be within the sensing range of the sensor, and we say that the POI is \"covered\" by the sensor. A single sensor can monitor all the POIs that are within its sensing range.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several static, immovable locations in space in which sensors can be installed. Those locations are often called \"installation spots\". A single sensor may be installed in each spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often a single sensor cannot monitor a POI to satisfaction (a condition called \"insufficient quality of service\"), so each POI must be covered by at least $\\dot{K}$ sensors. The number of sensors that cover a POI is called its \"coverage\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors are not designed to store or process the data collected. Instead, each sensor must transmit the data it has collected to other sensors. Those other sensors may re-transmit the data to other sensors, until it reaches a special sensor called SINK. A sink is a sensor capable of storing or processing data. We often cannot choose where the sinks are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors are prone to failure, so we ensure that the data from every POI is continually transmitted to the sink by guaranteeing that we have at least $\\dot{M}$ different sets of sensors capable of transmitting the data from each POI to a sink. Those sets must be disjunct - no sensor may belong to more than one set. Disjunct sets guarantee that even if failures in a set render it unable to get data from a POI to any sink, the sensors in other sets can deliver it. The number of disjunct sets of sensors that connect a POI to a sink is called its \"connectivity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors have a cost, so we want to install as few as possible while still guaranteeing that each POI is covered with at least $\\dot{K}$ different sensors and the data form each POI have at least $\\dot{M}$ different paths to a sink. This is the $\\dot{K}$-Coverage $\\dot{M}$-Connectivity problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent a instance of the KCMC problem as a [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)). In discrete mathematics, a graph is an structure formed by \"nodes\" or \"vertices\" (usually represented as circles or dots) distributead in any way in the space, since the exact position of each vertice is not relevant to the graph. Instead, the connections between nodes (the edges) is the information we are concerned with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our graph representation, each node in the graph may be:\n",
    "- installation spot for a sensor\n",
    "- a POI\n",
    "- a sink\n",
    "\n",
    "If a node represents a POI, it is connected to all installation spots where a sensors would be able to cover the POI.\n",
    "If the node represents a sink, it is connected to all instalation spots where sensors would be capable of transmitting data to the sink.\n",
    "If the node represent an installation spot for a sensor, it is connected to the POIs an installed sensor would able to cover, and all the sinks and other sensor installation spots that a sensor placed at the current spot would be able to communicate with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy to solve the KCMC problem is to find $\\dot{M}$ sets of sensor installation spots that form [Steiner trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem). Steiner trees are sub-graphs that connect a subset of nodes (the POIs and sinks) using as few as possible nodes that are not in the subset.\n",
    "The resulting $\\dot{M}$ minimal disjunct Steiner Trees contain all the sensor instalation spots we require to guarantee that each POI in the KCMC instance has at least $\\dot{M}$ connectivity.\n",
    "Then we simply add as few as possible sensor installation spots so that each POI has at least $\\dot{K}$ coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting way to describe our strategy is using an integer-linear programming [(ILP) formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), in which we use discrete linear algebra equations and inequations to describe the elements and constraints of the KCMC problem.\n",
    "ILP formulations are an standardized way of describing problems, and have many useful mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore our ILP formulation for the KCMC problem and implement it to obtain solutions. "
